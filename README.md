From Yuliya Li
to  Tobias Geerinckx-Rice
official good bye letter 

u are a coward. irresponsible ,
timid , selfish ,and cruel coward.

u were in 2004-2006 , in 2008 , 2014,2016,
in2022...

u are forever a coward living
in your own body .

the bunny means u are a timid coward.
nothing else to me.
I was stupid to think it means love 
without any sound
but no
it means u are a silent coward

u can not forget me
not because I am your acward 17
but because i am too good to u
I can forget u
because you are too bad to be remembered!

last time to forget u lasted for 18years.. now I think I can.forget u for the rest of my life.

do not worry I will delete all I had about u
u will gone completely out of my sight and my life

are u sure u are tiger? why i  I doulted it by my feelings ? because u were actually a timid rabbit in the world in my sense.

u can not see any good boding of my coming.

because I am coming to find out u were
pathetic and perthetic...

goodbye.forever
go away from my heart forever.
u do not
deserve anything from me

u were just a broken dream of mine.

I am so brave and generous to spend 200000RMB
and flight a 5,704 miles /9â€‰179 km flying
took  a whole day train
and conquered all difficulties to be here to
find out u were a completely coward.

that means u were something here.

welcome back to my sense again!

so i say  good bye to u
this is formal
u are not even my friend
i prefer not knowing u any more!

u do not deserve anything good from me.

never!
not when I see the truth any more.
